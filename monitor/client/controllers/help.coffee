        <p>There are 5 parameters :
          <ul>
            <li>Tolerance: if the difference between the ratio L / D of two consecutive iteration is inferior to the tolerance, then the optimizer will pass to the next parameter.</li>
            <li>Default Step: the step which is use by the optimizer to tweak the parameters.</li>
            <li>c - Chord Length: the length of the imaginary straight line joining the leading and trailing edges of the airfoil.</li>
            <li>t - the maximum thickness of the airfoil as a fraction of the chord length c.</li>
            <li>Î¸ - Angle of Attack: the angle between the chord line and the vector representing the relative motion between the body and the fluid through which it is moving.</li>
